<h1>Debugging JavaScript with mosync.rlog in Reload</h1>
<p>MoSync Reload includes a remote logging function, <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html5/mosync-resource.js.html#mosync.rlog">mosync.rlog</a>, which simplifies the debugging of your applications running on a device. In this tutorial we will show how to work with rlog and see results in the MoSync Reload Developer UI.<!--break--></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Debugging by Logging</h2>
<p>Logging is good old debugging method. A problem with mobile devices is that it might be hard to actually output the debug log data somewhere, and to view the data. The mosync.rlog function in Reload is meant to solve this problem, by sending debug log data over the network, from the device to the Reload Developer UI.</p>
<p>The JavaScript syntax is very simple:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">mosync.rlog("Hello World");</pre>
<p>Here is the result shown under the <strong>Log</strong> tab in the Reload UI:</p>
<p><img src="images/Reload_Log_Example0_Highlighted.png" align="none" width="650" height="439"></p>
<p>Note the <strong>Clear console log</strong> button at the bottom of the Log view, it is used to clear the log output.</p>
<h2>Creating a Test Project</h2>
<p>To get started with this tutorial on using mosync.rlog, first read the guide <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/reload/guides/quick-start/mosync-reload-quick-start/index.html">Using MoSync Reload</a> if you have not done that already, and connect at least one client device to the Reload UI/Server.</p>
<p>Now in the Reload Developer UI create a test project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>New Project</strong>&nbsp; button.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Web based</strong> project template.</li>
<li>Enter the project name <strong>RlogTestApp</strong> and click <strong>Create</strong>. You will now see your project in Reload's project list.</li>
<li>Make sure you have a device or emumator running the Reload Client connected.</li>
<li>Select the project&nbsp;<strong>RlogTestApp</strong> in the project list by clicking it.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Reload Project</strong>&nbsp; button. The app will be sent to the device and loaded.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>The Reload project templates are actually working applications, so when the app appears on the device you can play around with it by clicking its buttons.</p>
</blockquote><p><img src="images/reload-rlog-tutorial-03.png" align="none" width="266" height="482"></p>
<h2>Adding Log Statements to Your Code</h2>
<p>Now edit the JavaScript code by clicking <strong>Open</strong> to view the project files and then open <em>index.html</em> in your favourite text editor .</p>
<p>Find the JavaScript function called <strong>displayDeviceInfo()</strong> and add two <strong>mosync.rlog</strong> statements to the end of the function:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">function displayDeviceInfo()
{
    document.getElementById("platform").innerHTML = device.platform;
    document.getElementById("version").innerHTML = device.version;
    document.getElementById("uuid").innerHTML = device.uuid;
    document.getElementById("name").innerHTML = device.name;
    document.getElementById("width").innerHTML = screen.width;
    document.getElementById("height").innerHTML = screen.height;
    mosync.rlog("Device name: " + device.name);
    mosync.rlog("Device version: " + device.version);
}</pre>
<p>Similiarly, find the <strong>vibrate()</strong> function and add another <strong>mosync.rlog</strong> statement there:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">function vibrate()
{
    navigator.notification.vibrate(500);
    mosync.rlog("I vibrated!");
}
</pre>
<p>Save your <strong>index.html</strong> file.</p>
<h2>Viewing the Log Output</h2>
<p>Switch to the <strong>Log</strong> tab in the UI, and reload your app to the client by clicking the <strong>Reload </strong>button.</p>
<p>You should see the output from the first two <strong>mosync.rlog</strong> statements which are executed as soon as the app is reloaded:</p>
<p><img src="images/Reload_Log_Example1.png" align="none" width="650" height="439"></p>
<p>Try clicking the <strong>Reload </strong>button again. You will see that every time the project reloads, old output is cleared automatically and output is displayed. To clear the Log manually, just click <strong>Clear console log</strong> at any time.</p>
<p>Now click the <strong>Vibrate </strong>button on the client device. This time the <strong>mosync.rlog</strong> statement in our <strong>vibrate()</strong> function will be executed and a message is displayed:</p>
<p><img src="images/Reload_Log_Example2.png" align="none" width="650" height="439"></p>
<h2>Using mosync.rlog with console.log</h2>
<p>The <strong>mosync.rlog</strong> function works the same way as <strong>console.log</strong> and has been designed so as not to conflict with it. If you wish, you can override <strong>console.log</strong> with <strong>mosync.rlog</strong> in your code like this:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">console.log = mosync.rlog;
</pre>
<h2>Using Logging on Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>By providing the device name as part of the log message it is possible to see which device the message comes from. You could also add additional info, like the screen width of the device. For example, if you have two devices, and wish to see on which one the Vibrate button was touched, then write the following code in the <strong>vibrate()</strong> function:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">function vibrate()
{
    navigator.notification.vibrate(500);
    mosync.rlog(
        "I vibrated! ("
        + device.name
        + " - screen width: " 
        + screen.width 
        + ")");
}</pre>
<p>Here is an example of the console output when reloading with two devices connected, and pressing Vibrate on each one of them:</p>
<p><img src="images/Reload_Log_Example4.png" align="none" width="650" height="439"></p>
<h2>Using mosync.log</h2>
<p>It is worth mentioning that there is also a function in wormhole.js that is called <strong>mosync.log()</strong>. This function works independently of the Reload Server and UI, and can be used also with an app built using the MoSync SDK. It writes log output using the MoSync sycall maWriteLog(). The syntax is very simple:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">mosync.log("Hello World");</pre>
<p>The output is sent to the logcat console on Android, and to the Xcode console on iOS. This can be especially useful when debugging iOS apps, since console.log does write any debug output on iOS.</p>
<h2>What to Try Next</h2>
<p>Have you seen the guide on how to use the <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/reload/guides/tools/using-javascript-workbench/index.html">JavaScript Workbench</a>? It is fun to try :-)</p>
