**Please note that it is important to use the same version of the Reload Client app and the Reload Server. If you install a new version of the Reload Server package, make sure you also install the new version of the client.**

# Reload Client App

Reload Client is an app that you install on your device to connect to the Reload Server and the Development UI. The client app works as a container, it downloads your project and runs it on the device. 

It should be noted that the app is written using the MoSync SDK, with the full source code available. This means that you can build the Reload Client yourself, and modify the code to suite your needs. Be aware of the version of the client code you use, it must match the Reload Server/Development UI. You can get the Reload Client source code from GitHub: [OneOne]() branch, [master]() branch.
